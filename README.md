# Rentopedia
Rentopedia is a web application that provides house rental service.

* Using this app, house owners can post ads for their house mentioning details and photos  to rent it. House seekers can find houses, filter ads by places and send a booking request to book a house. If the house owner accepts that request, the house ad will be booked and disappear.

* This project can't be run by cloning this repository. Because Firebase Key and .env files were not uploaded here as it's a public repository.
* Please navigate to https://rentopediasd.herokuapp.com/ for the actual output.
